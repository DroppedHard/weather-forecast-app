# Weather Forecast App / Prognoza Pogody

This is just a simple weather app, that asks for location permission, and based on current location - or any location selected by user - it fetches weather information from [other API](https://open-meteo.com) that is parsed from [backend API](https://github.com/DroppedHard/weather-forecast-api)

# How to start the app

1. clone this repository
2. instal all dependencies
```cmd
npm install
``` 
3. Run application in development mode
```cmd
npm run dev
```

App is made in Polish, therefore I tried to polish as much as I could in limited time :)
